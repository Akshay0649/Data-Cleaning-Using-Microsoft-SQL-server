# Data-Cleaning and Data Exploration Using Microsoft SQL Server

## Project Overview
Welcome to the Nashville Housing Data Cleaning Project! To enhance the Kaggle Nashville housing dataset using Microsoft SQL Server. By meticulously cleaning and transforming the data, I aimed to provide a more robust and structured resource for the Better Exploration of Dataset.

## Project Goals
### Data Cleaning
1. Standardize date formats for accurate temporal analysis.
2. Populate missing property addresses for comprehensive spatial insights.
3. Break down address and owner information into distinct components.
4. Enhance data clarity by converting "Y" and "N" values to "Yes" and "No."
5. Eliminate duplicates to ensure accurate analysis.
6. Streamline the dataset by removing unnecessary columns.
### Data Exploration
1. Understanding Property Value Trends by Year Built.
2. Analyzing the Impact of Bedrooms and Bathrooms.
3. Exploring Property Value and Acreage Relationship.
4. Comparing Property Values Across Cities.
5. Identifying High-Selling Months.
6. Evaluating Sale Price and Assessed Value.
7. Investigating Property Value by Land Use.

## Visual Insights

## Challenges Overcome
During the data cleaning process, faced challenges such as dealing with missing values, complex address parsing, and identifying unique records. Through meticulous testing and iterative problem-solving, I was able to successfully address these issues and ensure the dataset's accuracy and reliability to use.

## Technologies Used
Microsoft SQL Server for data cleaning and transformation.
SQL queries to handle data manipulation and organization.
Code Quality and Organization
The project's SQL scripts are organized and well-structured. I've provided comments and documentation within the code to guide readers through the cleaning process and the rationale behind each step.

## Collaboration and Teamwork
This project was a solo endeavor, allowing me to fully engage with the data and develop comprehensive cleaning strategies. However, I am experienced in collaborative settings and look forward to leveraging these skills in future projects.

## Impact and Future Work
The cleaned Nashville housing dataset is a valuable resource for further analysis. It can be utilized to derive insights into real estate trends, property values, and housing dynamics. Future work could involve predictive modeling, geospatial analysis, or correlating the housing data with external socio-economic factors.

## Learning and Growth
Throughout this project, I honed my SQL skills, deepened my understanding of data-cleaning methodologies, and strengthened my ability to tackle complex data challenges. This experience has further solidified my passion for data analysis and its potential to uncover meaningful insights.
